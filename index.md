### Research interests

I am trying to discover the computational principles of information processing and learning in the brain. Bayesian inference and statistical learning theory provide me with the mathematical framework for addressing these questions. I employ tractable behavioral experiments to reveal how humans and animals learn to cope with uncertain and ambiguous sensory evidence in their environment, and I explore in computational models how the required mathematical operations could be implemented in neuronal networks. My work further spawns engineering applications by developing operating principles for novel, brain-inspired computing architectures. My research is situated at the interface of cognitive science, neuroscience, machine learning and electrical engineering.

### Short bio

After my physics studies at Heidelberg University, Germany, I joined the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science in Graz, Austria, for my doctoral studies with [Robert Legenstein](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/igi/people/prof-legenstein/). After my PhD, [Karlheinz Meier](https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/vision/people/karlheinz/) gave me the opportunity to give a course on Brain-inspired Computing at the Physics Department in Heidelberg. In 2017, I joined the groups of [Jan Drugowitsch](https://drugowitschlab.hms.harvard.edu/people-0) (Neurobiology) and [Sam Gershman](http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/people/sam.html) (Psychology) at Harvard University.
